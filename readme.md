# AI-Based Intelligent Camera System for Enhanced Surveillance

## Problem Statement

Traditional surveillance relies on human operators, leading to challenges like fatigue, inefficiency, and delayed responses. Continuous tracking and security in police lockups face limitations.

## Solution Overview

Develop an AI-based intelligent camera system to automate real-time video analysis, efficient decision-making, and targeted threat detection, overcoming human surveillance challenges.

## Key Features

- **AI-Based System:** Utilizes machine learning for automatic real-time video analysis.
- **Advanced Algorithms:** Implements smart camera algorithms to differentiate between normal and suspicious activities.
- **Identify Risky Items and Movements:** Detects potentially harmful objects and actions such as climbing, drilling, or suspicious interactions.
- **Machine Learning Techniques:** Adapts and refines decision-making skills based on continuous feedback.
- **Triggers for Suspicious Activity:** Establishes real-time triggers to identify anomalies in lockup environments.

## Examples of Triggers

1. Unusual movement or behavior of individuals in the lockup.
2. Anomalies in interactions between accused individuals and law enforcement.
3. Actions that deviate from normal behavior and might indicate potential problems.

## Real-Time Decision-Making

The system responds promptly to suspicious triggers, enhancing security measures through quick, autonomous decision-making.

## Autonomous Analysis

The AI system autonomously examines video streams, eliminating the need for constant human intervention.

## Integration with Kotlin Compose Multiplatform App and Firebase

### Overview

Integrate the AI surveillance system with a Kotlin Compose mobile application, utilizing Firebase for real-time data communication and sharing.

### Features

#### Real-time Notifications

- Sends push notifications to police officers' devices when suspicious activities are detected.
- Provides snapshot data from the AI surveillance system for immediate review.

#### Location Coordinates

- Embeds precise location coordinates within the notification, aiding officers in identifying the incident location.

#### Emergency Services Integration

- Allows officers to request emergency services (e.g., ambulance, fire brigade) through the Kotlin Compose app.
- Includes a dedicated interface for officers to communicate and coordinate responses.

#### Incident Logging and Reporting

- Records incident details, including timestamps, AI snapshot images, and officer responses.
- Provides an interface for officers to add additional notes and details.

### How to Use
